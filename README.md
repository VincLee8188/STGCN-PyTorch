# STGCN_Pytorch_version
 I try to make the  Pytorch-version implementation of  the spatio-temporal graph convolutional network proposed in [Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875) by Bing Yu, Haoteng Yin, Zhanxing Zhu.

The author's original  implementations in TensorFlow can be found here:

  * [TensorFlow](https://github.com/PKUAI26/STGCN-IJCAI-18) 

 ## Requirements

  * PyTorch
  * Pandas
  * scipy
  * numpy
  * Pycharm community
  * Tensorboard

 ## Dataset

The dataset of 228 routes mentioned in the author's documents are included in the 'dataset' directory.
