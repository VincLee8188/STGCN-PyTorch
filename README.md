# STGCN-Pytorch
I tried to construct the Pytorch-version implementation of the spatio-temporal graph convolutional network proposed in [Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875) by Bing Yu, Haoteng Yin, Zhanxing Zhu.

The author's original implementations in TensorFlow can be found here and my code structure is borrowed from him:

  * [TensorFlow](https://github.com/PKUAI26/STGCN-IJCAI-18) 

 ## Requirements

  * PyTorch
  * Pandas
  * Scipy
  * Numpy

 ## Dataset

The dataset of 228 routes mentioned in the author's documents are included in the 'dataset' directory.
